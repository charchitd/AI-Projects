# Data — Synthetic Microscopy + Multi-view Features (Shareable)

This folder stores the generated microscopy data and intermediate artefacts for this Project pipeline.  
All data is **synthetic** and generated locally, allowing full reproducibility with no lab/patient data.

## What’s inside

### `raw/`
Generated inputs for the pipeline:
- `microscopy_image.npy` — synthetic microscopy-like image (float array)
- `gt_mask.npy` — ground-truth instance mask (each cell has a unique ID)
- `cell_metadata.csv` — synthetic cell properties (location, radius, intensity, true type)
- `barcode_view.csv` — second view (“BARseq-like”) features per ground-truth cell  
  - includes `bar_*` and `prj_*` columns representing barcode/projection signals

**Generated by:** `scripts/01_generate_synthetic_microscopy.py`

### `processed/`
Intermediate outputs produced during segmentation + feature extraction:
- `seg_mask.npy` — predicted segmentation mask (baseline)
- `morph_features.csv` — morphology/intensity features extracted from segmented regions
- `mapped_cells.csv` — mapping between segmented regions and ground-truth cell IDs  
  (used to join barcode view and evaluate clustering)

**Generated by:** `scripts/02_segment_cells.py` and `scripts/03_extract_features.py`
