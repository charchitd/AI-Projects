# Data — Synthetic Unscheduled Care Event Log (Shareable)

This folder stores the datasets used in the Project pipeline.  
To keep the project shareable and privacy-safe, the repo generates **synthetic** event data that mimics unscheduled-care patient journeys (no real patient data is included).

---

## What’s inside

### `raw/`
Contains the generated event-level dataset (one row per patient event), typically including:
- `patient_id` (synthetic identifier)
- `timestamp` or event time
- `event_type` / `service_step` (e.g., triage, vitals, labs, treatment, discharge/admission)
- basic patient/context features used for modelling (synthetic)

**Generated by:** `scripts/01_generate_synthetic_ehr.py`

---

### `processed/`
Contains cleaned and engineered tables derived from `raw/`, such as:
- journey sequences (ordered events per patient)
- early-pathway features (e.g., first-N events, transition counts, wait-time features)
- modelling tables used for clustering and outcome prediction

**Generated by:** `scripts/02_build_sequences.py` (and downstream scripts)

---

## How to regenerate
From the repo root:
```bash
python scripts/01_generate_synthetic_ehr.py
python scripts/02_build_sequences.py
